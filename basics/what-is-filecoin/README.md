# An Introduction to Filecoin

Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files with built-in economic incentives and cryptography to ensure files are reliably stored over time. In Filecoin, users pay to store their files on storage providers. Storage providers are computers responsible for storing files and proving they have stored them correctly over time. Anyone who wants to store their files or get paid for storing othersâ€™ files can join Filecoin. Available storage and pricing are not controlled by any single company; instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in.

Filecoin is built on top of the same software powering the [IPFS protocol](https://docs.ipfs.tech/). IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed storage network that leverages [content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) to create permanent data references without relying on specific devices or cloud servers. Filecoin differs from IPFS by adding an incentive layer, which encourages reliable storage and easy access to content.

Filecoin enables several use cases, including Web3-native NFT storage, metaverse and game asset storage, and incentivized permanent storage. It also provides an affordable solution for archiving Web2 datasets, making it a compelling alternative to traditional cloud storage.

For example, [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/) uses Filecoin to offer decentralized storage for NFT content and metadata. Additionally, organizations like the [Shoah Foundation](https://sfi.usc.edu/) and [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) leverage Filecoin for content backup.

Beyond these, Filecoin supports a wide range of data formats, including audio and video files. This functionality allows Web3 platforms like [Audius](https://audius.co/) and [Huddle01](https://huddle01.com/) to use Filecoin as a decentralized storage backend for music streaming and video conferencing.
